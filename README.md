# Tourism-Management-System
The main task was to build database of Tourism company which consists of data of tourists, places of interest, travel destinations and some innovative services provided by tourist company. PostgreSQL was used to build the database.

The tourism activity has slowed down since the pandemic Covid-19 and
indirectly affected the whole world. Create a database for a system that
consists of the data of tourists, places of interest, types of interest, their
travel destinations, and some innovative services provided by the tourist
company to boost tourism. For example, many companies like Taj,
Mahindra provide different 5-10years packages to keep people traveling.
Make sure the database includes such different strategies of packages and
offers provided by different companies. Users should be able to find the best
places based on their interest, budget, and safe locations to travel based
on COVID spread.
